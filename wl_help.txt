THIS IS THE HELP TEXT FILE FOR THE WORK LOG SCRIPT.
_ah_title, 3
 A task must have a title.¤
The title can contain any characters.¤
The title does not have to be unique.
_ah_date, 15
 Dates can be entered--¤
With numbers and dashes, slashes or dots, with 2 or 4 numbers for the
year:  [7-15-12], [11/9/10], [5.15.2018].¤
As a day relative to today:  [today], [yesterday], [tomorrow], [day
before yesterday], [day after tomorrow].¤
(Extra words like "the" and "of" are ignored.)¤
As a day of the week in the current week:  [Monday], [wed], [sa].¤
As a day of the week from two weeks prior to two weeks following:
[monday after next], [next Fri], [last We], [Sat before last]¤
If a date is not valid in the selected format, the program
will check to see if it is valid in a different format, and if it is,
the program will ask if you want to change the date format to match.¤
When creating an entry, pressing [ENTER] will default to today.  When
editing an entry, pressing [ENTER] will leave the original date
unchanged.
_ah_time, 8
 Times can be entered using--¤
Numbers with or without a colon:  [15:30], [921]).¤
All valid number words will be converted to numerals:  [2 ten p.m.],
[eleven 55am].¤
All times between 1:00 and 12:59 are assumed to be a.m.
unless p.m. is specified.¤
Minutes can be entered using "after", "til"/"until" or "half":
[15 til three p.m.], [ten after 3a], [half 11 pm]).
_ah_duration, 8
 Duration can be entered--¤
Directly in minutes, hours, and/or days:  [15 minutes], [one and a half
hours], [one day, 15 hours, 27 minutes]).¤
Or as an ending time.  If an ending time is entered,
the start time will be subtracted from it to determine the task's
duration.¤
Zero minutes is a valid duration, so the start and end times can be the
same.)
_ah_note, 1
 Adding a note for a task is optional.  Any text can be a note.
_ah_recurrance1, 10
 A task can be set to recur at regular intervals for a period of time.
The interval can be based on one or more days of the week (for example,
every other Saturday, every other Tuesday and Thursday), on days during
the month (such as the 2nd Saturday, or the 1st, 3rd and 4th Monday and
Friday) or on dates (the 1st and the 15th, or the 22nd, or the next to
the last day of the month).  A task set to recur based on days or dates
in a month can be set to skip months (such as the 10th of every third
month).¤
See the User Manual (available from the main menu) for a detailed
walkthough of recurrance-setting.
_ah_recurrance2, 3
 If you would like this task to recur at regular intervals (once per day,
week or month), please select that interval below.  If you would like
this task to repeat at any other interval, select [Other].
_ah_recurrance3, 5
 If you want the task to recur on one or more specific days of the week
(for example, on Tuesdays, or on Wednesdays and Saturdays), select "days
of the week".  If you want the task to recur on one ore more specific
days of the month (for example, on the 5th, or on the 13th and 28th, or
on the 2nd Tuesday or 4th Friday), select [days of the month].
_ah_recurrance4, 4
Enter the date or dates of the month on which you want the task to
recur, separated by commas.  To count backwards from the end of the
month, enter negative numbers:  -1 for the last day of the month, -2 for
the next to the last day, and so on.
_sh_text, 13
 Enter one or more words or phrases to search for.  To search for an
exact phrase, enclose it in quote marks.  All searches are OR-based
unless specified otherwise.  All searches are case-insensitive.  Use [+]
or the word "and" to make a search (or part of a search) AND-based.  You
can (but do not need to) use [|] or the word "or" to explicitly make a
search OR-based.  You can also use parentheses to group parts of a search.¤
Wildcards:  use [?] for a single character and [*] for any number of
characters.¤
NOTE:  You can also search for question marks and asterisks as literal
character, rather than as wildcards.¤
See the User Manual (available from the main menu) for a complete
explanation of the program's search capabilities, including examples of
all variations.
_sh_re, 8
 WARNING:  This option should be used only by users who are familiar with
the format of regular expressions.  Other than ensuring that it is
compilable, the program will make no attempt to validate the expression.
Do not use quotation marks when entering an expression.¤
NOTE:  Searches using regular expressions are CASE-SENSITIVE unless
specified otherwise.  Append [, re.I] to the end of your expression to
make the search case-insensitive.  (No other regular expression flags
are meaningful for this program.)
_eh_edit, 6
 The title, date, time, duration, and notes for a task can be edited.
Note that changes are not made until the edited entry is saved, and the
log file must be saved for changes to become permanent.  If the task
being edited is one occurrance in a series, any changes (except to the
date) can be applied to either the occurrance being edited, or to the
entire series.
_xh_settings, 5
 You can set the format for dates to American (M/D/Y), European (D/M/Y)
or Asian (Y/M/D) here.  You can also set the format for times to either a
12- or 24-hour clock.  Finally, you can set the width of the screen,
which defaults to 80 characters.  You can make the screen as narrow as
40 characters, or as wide as you would like.
