Project #3 of the Treehouse Python Techdegree - Work Log

This repository contains all of the code files associated with Project #3 for the Treehouse Python
Techdegree, plus a sample test.csv file which can be used with the script.  The main script is in
the file worklog_main.py.

CAUTION!!!  This script uses Comma Separated Value (.csv) files to store data.  DO NOT SAVE A WORK
LOG CSV FILE USING EXCEL OR ANY OTHER PROGRAM EXCEPT NOTEPAD OR ANOTHER BASIC TEXT EDITOR!!!  The
strings representing dates and times are stored in a specific format, which Excel or other spreadsheet
programs may (will) override with their own formats.  This will cause the Work Log script to be unable
to read those values.
