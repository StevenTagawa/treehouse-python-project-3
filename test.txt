_ah_title, 8
A task must have a title, but the title can be any inputable text, and
does not have to be unique.  Note, however, that any title search will
always find all tasks that have duplicate names.  (For example, if two
tasks are titled "My Task", any title search that finds one will also
find the other.)  Adding unique identifiers can make searching more
efficient.  (For example, two tasks titled "My Task 1" and "My Task 2"
can still both be found by searching for "My Task*", while also being
searchable individually.)
_ah_date, 14
The date of a task can be entered with numbers and dashes or slashes
(for example, 7-15-12 or 11/9/10).  Leading zeroes are not required
(even for the year; the program will interpret "8" in the year position
as "2008").  If a date is not valid in the selected format,
Dates can also be entered as relative words or phrases.  To
set a task for the current day, enter "today" (or just press [ENTER]).
"Yesterday," "tomorrow," "day before yesterday" and "day after tomorrow"
also also valid entries.  A specific day of the week in any week from
two weeks in the past until two weeks in the future can be specified:
"Tuesday before last", "last Tuesday", "this Tuesday", "next Tuesday",
or "Tuesday after next".  A day of the week entered by itself will be
interpreted as that day of the current week.
NOTE:  When editing an existing entry, pressing [ENTER] will leave the
existing date unchanged, rather than changing it to the current day.
_ah_time, 9
Times can be entered using numbers or words.  Numeric times can be
entered with our without a colon ("15:30", "921").  Because all valid
number words will be converted to numerals, any mix of words and
numerals (e.g., "2 ten p.m.", "eleven 55am") will be correctly
interpreted.  All times between 1:00 and 12:59 will be assumed to be
a.m. unless p.m. is specified.  If the time format is set to 12-hour
time, a.m. or p.m. must always be specified.  Minutes can be entered
using "after" or "til"/"until" ("15 til three p.m.").  The British idiom
"half" ("half 11 pm") is also valid.
_ah_duration, 6
To set a task's duration, enter either the duration directly in minutes,
hours, and/or days (e.g. "15 minutes", "one and a half hours", "one day,
15 hours, 27 minutes") or an ending time.  If an ending time is entered,
the start time will be subtracted from it to determine the task's
duration.  (The end time cannot be before the start time, but a task can
be set to zero minutes, so the start and end times can be the same.)
_ah_note, 1
Adding a note for a task is optional.  Any text can be a note.
_ah_recurrance1, 10
A task can be set to recur at regular intervals for a period of time.
The interval can be based on one or more days of the week (for example,
every other Saturday, every other Tuesday and Thursday), on days during
the month (such as the 2nd Saturday, or the 1st, 3rd and 4th Monday and
Friday) or on dates (the 1st and the 15th, or the 22nd, or the next to
the last day of the month).  A task set to recur based on days or dates
in a month can be set to skip months (such as the 10th of every third
month).  However, if you set a task to recur on more than one day of the
week, the days must have the same interval (for example, you cannot set
a task to recur every other Tuesday and every third Thursday).
_ah_recurrance2, 3
If you would like this task to recur at regular intervals, please select
an interval below.  If you would like this task to repeat at a specific
interval other than daily, weekly or monthly, select "Other".
_ah_recurrance3, 5
If you want the task to recur on one or more specific days of the week
(for example, on Tuesdays, or on Wednesdays and Saturdays), select "days
of the week".  If you want the task to recur on one ore more specific
days of the month (for example, on the 5th, or on the 13th and 28th),
select "days of the month".
_ah_recurrance4, 4
Enter the date or dates of the month on which you want the task to
recur, separated by commas.  To count backwards from the end of the
month, enter negative numbers:  -1 for the last day of the month, -2 for
the next to the last day, and so on.
_sh_text, 20
Enter one or more words or phrases to search for.  To search for an
exact phrase, enclose it in quote marks.  All searches are OR-based
unless specified otherwise.  For example, [study greek] will find all
entries containing the word "study" OR the word "greek"; ["study greek"]
will find all entries containing the phrase "study greek".  All searches
are case-insensitive.  Use [+] or the word "and" to make a search (or
part of a search) AND-based.  For example, [office + break] will find
all entries containing the word "office" AND the word "break" (whether
they are together or separated).  You can (but do not need to) use [|]
or the word "or" to explicitly make a search OR-based.  You can also
use parentheses to group parts of a search:  ["study hall" + (afternoon
saturday)] will find all entries containing the phrase "study hall" AND
either the word "afternoon" OR the word "saturday").¤
Wildcards:  use [?] for a single character ([c?t] matches "cat", "cot",
"cut") and [*] for any number of characters ([east*] matches "easter",
"eastern", "easterly" (but not "east"); [c*ot] matches "cannot",
"carrot", "compatriot"; [s?ll*] matches "sallow", "silly", "syllable").¤
NOTE:  You can use question marks and asterisks in titles and notes, and
search for them directly, by telling the program to perform a literal
search rather than a wildcard search.
_sh_re, 8
WARNING:  This option should be used only by users who are familiar with
the Python programming language and the format of regular expressions.
The program will make no attempt to validate the expression entered, and
malformed expressions may produce unexpected results.¤
NOTE:  Searches using regular expressions are case-sensitive unless
specified otherwise.  To make a regular expression search case-
insensitive, append [, re.I] to the end of the expression.  (No other
regular expression flags are meaningful for this program.)
_eh_edit, 9
The title, date, time, duration, and notes for a task can be edited.
Note that changes are not made until the edited entry is saved, and the
log file must be saved for changes to become permanent.  If the task
being edited is one occurrance in a series, any changes (except to the
date) can be applied to either the occurrance being edited, or to the
entire series.  Note that this choice will apply to all changes made
while editing the entry; if you want to make some changes to a single
occurrance and other changes to the entire series, you will need to edit
the entry twice.
